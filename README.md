# 1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to **learn from data** and make predictions or decisions **without explicit programming**.

## 🔹 How ML Works?
1. **Data Collection** – Gather data (CSV, images, text, etc.).
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, transform, and prepare the data.
3. **Model Training** – Use an ML algorithm to learn patterns from data.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Test the model’s performance on unseen data.
5. **Model Deployment** – Deploy the trained model for real-world use.

# 2️⃣ Types of Machine Learning
## 🔹 1. Supervised Learning (Labeled Data)
- The model is trained with **input-output pairs**.
- Used for **prediction** and **classification** tasks.

**Examples:**
✅ Spam Detection (Email: Spam/Not Spam)  
✅ House Price Prediction (Price based on features)

🔸 **Common Algorithms:**  
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Neural Networks  

---

## 🔹 2. Unsupervised Learning (No Labels)
- The model learns patterns **without labeled data**.
- Used for **clustering and association** tasks.

**Examples:**
✅ Customer Segmentation (Grouping customers based on behavior)  
✅ Anomaly Detection (Fraud detection in transactions)

🔸 **Common Algorithms:**  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Autoencoders  

---

## 🔹 3. Reinforcement Learning
- The model learns by **trial and error** in an environment.
- Used in **robotics, gaming, self-driving cars**.

**Examples:**
✅ Chess-playing AI (AlphaGo)  
✅ Self-driving Cars  

🔸 **Common Algorithms:**  
- Q-Learning  
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)  
- Policy Gradient Methods  

---

# 3️⃣ Essential ML Libraries (Python)
To implement ML, install the following libraries:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** – ML models
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep Learning

---

# 4️⃣ Understanding Data (Pandas & NumPy)
Before training ML models, we must **analyze and preprocess the data**.

## 🔹 Load & Explore Data
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv")

# Show first 5 rows
print(df.head())

# Check missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Summary statistics
print(df.describe())
```

✅ **Key Concepts:**
- `.head()` – View first 5 rows  
- `.isnull().sum()` – Check for missing values  
- `.describe()` – Get summary statistics  

---

# 5️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Before feeding data into ML models, we must **clean and transform it**.

## 🔹 Handling Missing Values
```python
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Replace missing values with mean
```

## 🔹 Encoding Categorical Data
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['species'] = encoder.fit_transform(df['species'])
```

## 🔹 Feature Scaling (Normalization)
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df.iloc[:, :-1])  # Exclude target column
```

---

# 6️⃣ Supervised Learning Algorithms
## 🔹 1. Linear Regression (For Continuous Output)
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df[['sepal_length']]
y = df['petal_length']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Predictions:", model.predict(X_test))
```

✅ **Use Cases:** House price prediction, Stock price forecasting
